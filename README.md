# gfx-rs

gfx-rs is a low-level, cross-platform graphics abstraction library in Rust. It consists of the following layers/components:

* `gfx-hal` which is gfx's hardware abstraction layer: a Vulkan-ic mostly unsafe API which translates to native graphics backends.
* `gfx-backend-*` which contains graphics backends for various platforms:
  * [Vulkan](src/backend/vulkan)
  * [DirectX 12](src/backend/dx12)
  * [Metal](src/backend/metal)
  * [OpenGL 2.1+/ES2+](src/backend/gl)
* `gfx-warden` which is a data-driven reference test framework, used to verify consistency across all graphics backends.

## Example

To run an example, simply use `cargo run` and specify the backend with `--features {backend}` (where `{backend}` is one of `vulkan`, `dx12`, `metal`, or `gl`). For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx
cd gfx/examples/hal
cargo run --bin quad --features vulkan
cargo run --bin compute --features dx12 1 2 3 4
```

This runs the `quad` example using the Vulkan backend, and then the `compute` example using the DirectX 12 backend.

These examples assume that necessary dependencies for the graphics backend are already installed. For more information about installation and usage, refer to the [Getting Started](info/getting_started.md) guide.

## Hardware Abstraction Layer

The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), is a thin, low-level graphics layer which translates API calls to various graphics backends, which allows for cross-platform support. The API of this layer is based on the Vulkan API, adapted to be more Rust-friendly.

Currently HAL has backends for Vulkan, DirectX 12, Metal, and OpenGL/OpenGL ES/WebGL.

The HAL layer is consumed directly by user applications or libraries. HAL is also used in efforts such as [gfx-portability](https://github.com/gfx-rs/portability).

## pre-LL

If you are looking for information about the released crates (`gfx_core`, `gfx`, `gfx_device_*`, `gfx_window_`, etc), they are being developed and published from the [pre-ll](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/tree/pre-ll) branch. Code in `master` is a complete rewrite that will be shipped in different crates.
