/// A `Slice` dictates in which and in what order vertices get processed. It is required for
/// processing a PSO.
///
/// # Overview
/// A `Slice` object in essence dictates in what order the vertices in a `VertexBuffer` get
/// processed. To do this, it contains an internal index-buffer. This `Buffer` is a list of
/// indices into this `VertexBuffer` (vertex-index). A vertex-index of 0 represents the first
/// vertex in the `VertexBuffer`, a vertex-index of 1 represents the second, 2 represents the
/// third, and so on. The vertex-indices in the index-buffer are read in order; every vertex-index
/// tells the pipeline which vertex to process next. 
///
/// Because the same index can re-appear multiple times, duplicate-vertices can be avoided. For
/// instance, if you want to draw a square, you need two triangles, and thus six vertices. Because
/// the same index can reappear multiple times, this means we can instead use 4 vertices, and 6
/// vertex-indices.
///
/// This index-buffer has a few variants. See the `IndexBuffer` documentation for a detailed
/// description.
///
/// The `start` and `end` fields say where in the index-buffer to start and stop reading.
/// Setting `start` to 0, and `end` to the length of the index-buffer, will cause the entire
/// index-buffer to be processed. The `base_vertex` dictates the index of the first vertex
/// in the `VertexBuffer`. This essentially moves the the start of the `VertexBuffer`, to the
/// vertex with this index.
///
/// # Constuction & Handling
/// The `Slice` structure can be constructed automatically when using a `Factory` to create a
/// vertex buffer. If needed, it can also be created manually.
///
/// A `Slice` is required to process a PSO, as it contains the needed information on in what order
/// to draw which vertices. As such, every `draw` call on an `Encoder` requires a `Slice`.
