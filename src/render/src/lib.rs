// TODO(doc) clarify the different type of queues and what is accessible from the high-level API
// vs what belongs to core-ll. There doesn't seem to be a "ComputeEncoder" can I submit something
// built with a GraphicsEncoder to a ComputeQueue?

//! # gfx
//!
//! An efficient, low-level, bindless graphics API for Rust.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! ## Command buffers and encoders and queues
//!
//! A command buffer is a serialized list of drawing and compute commands.
//! Unlike with vulkan, command buffers are not what you use to create commands, but only
//! the result of creating these commands. Gfx, borrowing metal's terminology, uses
//! encoders to build command buffers. This means that, in general, users of the gfx crate
//! don't manipulate command buffers directly much and interact mostly with graphics encoders.
//! In order to be executed, a command buffer is then submitted to a queue.
//!
//! Manipulating a `GraphicsEncoder` in gfx corresponds to interacting with:
//!
//! - a `VkCommandBuffer` in vulkan,
//! - a `MTLCommandEncoder` in metal,
//! - an `ID3D12GraphicsCommandList` in D3D12.
//!
//! OpenGL and earlier versions of D3D don't have an explicit notion of command buffers
//! encoders or queues (with the exception of draw indirect commands in late versions of OpenGL,
//! which can be seen as a GPU-side command buffer). They are managed implicitly by the driver.
//!
//! See:
//!
//! - The [`GraphicsEncoder` struct](struct.GraphicsEncoder.html).
//! - The [`CommandBuffer` trait](trait.CommandBuffer.html).
//! - The [`CommandQueue` struct](struct.CommandQueue.html).
//!
//! ## Devoce
//!
//! The device is what lets you allocate GPU resources such as buffers and textures.
//!
//! Each gfx backend provides its own device type which implements both:
//!
//! - The [`Device` trait](traits/trait.Device.html#overview).
//! - The [`DeviceExt` trait](traits/trait.DeviceExt.html).
//!
//! `gfx::Device` is roughly equivalent to:
//!
//! - `VkDevice` in vulkan,
//! - `ID3D11Device` in D3D11,
//! - `MTLDevice` in metal.
//!
//! OpenGL does not have a notion of device (resources are created directly off of the global
//! context). D3D11 has a DXGI factory but it is only used to interface with other processes
//! and the window manager, resources like textures are usually created using the device.
//!
//! ## Gpu
//!
//! The `Gpu` contains the `Device` and the `Queue`s.
//!
//! ## Pipeline state (PSO)
//!
//! See [the documentation of the gfx::pso module](pso/index.html).
//!
//! ## Memory management
//!
//! Handles internally use atomically reference counted pointers to deal with memory management.
//! GPU resources are not destroyed right away when all references to them are gone. Instead they
//! are destroyed the next time `cleanup` is called on the queue.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! See [the examples in the repository](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/tree/master/examples).
//!
//! # Useful resources
//!
//!  - [Documentation for some of the technical terms](doc/terminology/index.html)
//! used in the API.
//!  - [Learning gfx](https://wiki.alopex.li/LearningGfx) tutorial.
//!  - See [the blog](http://gfx-rs.github.io/) for more explanations and annotated examples.
