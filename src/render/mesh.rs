//! Mesh loading.
//!
//! A `Mesh` describes the geometry of an object. All or part of a `Mesh` can be drawn with a
//! single draw call. A `Mesh` consists of a series of vertices, each with a certain amount of
//! user-specified attributes. These attributes are fed into shader programs. The easiest way to
//! create a mesh is to use the `#[vertex_format]` attribute on a struct, upload them into a
//! `Buffer`, and then use `Mesh::from`.
