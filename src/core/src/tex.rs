//! Texture creation and modification.
//!
//! "Texture" is an overloaded term. In gfx-rs, a texture consists of two
//! separate pieces of information: image storage description (which is
//! immutable for a single texture object), and image data. To actually use a
//! texture, a "sampler" is needed, which provides a way of accessing the
//! image data.  Image data consists of an array of "texture elements", or
//! texels.
