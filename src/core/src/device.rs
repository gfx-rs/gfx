/// # Overview
///
/// A `Device` is responsible for creating and managing resources for the physical device
/// it was created from.
///
/// ## Resource Construction and Handling
///
/// This device structure can then be used to create and manage different resources, like buffers,
/// shader programs and textures. See the individual methods for more information.
///
/// This trait is extended by the [`gfx::DeviceExt` trait](https://docs.rs/gfx/*/gfx/traits/trait.DeviceExt.html).
/// All types implementing `Device` also implement `DeviceExt`.
///
///
/// ## Raw resources
///
/// The term "raw" is used in the context of types of functions that have a strongly typed and an
/// untyped equivalent, to refer to the untyped equivalent.
///
/// For example ['Device::create_buffer_raw'](trait.Device.html#tymethod.create_buffer_raw) and
/// ['Device::create_buffer'](trait.Device.html#tymethod.create_buffer)
///
/// ## Shader resource views and unordered access views
///
/// This terminology is borrowed from D3D.
///
/// Shader resource views typically wrap textures and buffers to provide read-only access in shaders.
/// An unordered access view provides similar functionality, but enables reading and writing to
/// the buffer or texture in any order.
///
/// See:
///
/// - [The gfx::UNORDERED_ACCESS bit in the gfx::Bind flags](../gfx/struct.Bind.html).
/// - [Device::view_buffer_as_unordered_access](trait.Device.html#method.view_buffer_as_unordered_access).
