//! Windowing system interoperability
//!
//! Screen presentation (fullscreen or window) of images requires two objects:
//!
//! * [`Surface`] is the host abstraction of the native screen
//! * [`Swapchain`] is the device abstraction for a surface, containing multiple presentable images
//!
//! ## Window
//!
//! // DOC TODO
//!
//! ## Surface
//!
//! // DOC TODO
//!
//! ## Swapchain
//!
//! The most interesting part of a swapchain are the contained presentable images/backbuffers.
//! Presentable images are specialized images, which can be presented on the screen. They are
//! 2D color images with optionally associated depth-stencil images.
//!
//! The common steps for presentation of a frame are acquisition and presentation:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # extern crate gfx_backend_empty as empty;
//! # extern crate gfx_hal;
//! # fn main() {
//! use gfx_hal::{Device, FrameSync};
//! # use gfx_hal::{CommandQueue, Graphics, Swapchain};
//!
//! # let mut swapchain: empty::Swapchain = return;
//! # let device: empty::Device = return;
//! # let mut present_queue: CommandQueue<empty::Backend, Graphics> = return;
//! let acquisition_semaphore = device.create_semaphore();
//! let render_semaphore = device.create_semaphore();
//!
//! let frame = swapchain.acquire_image(FrameSync::Semaphore(&acquisition_semaphore));
//! // render the scene..
//! // `render_semaphore` will be signalled once rendering has been finished
//! swapchain.present(&mut present_queue, 0, &[render_semaphore]);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Queues need to synchronize with the presentation engine, usually done via signalling a semaphore
//! once a frame is available for rendering and waiting on a separate semaphore until scene rendering
//! has finished.
//!
