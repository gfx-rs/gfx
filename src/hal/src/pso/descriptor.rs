//! Descriptor sets and layouts.
//!
//! A [`Descriptor`] is an object that describes the connection between a resource, such as
//! an `Image` or `Buffer`, and a variable in a shader. Descriptors are organized into
//! `DescriptorSet`s, each of which contains multiple descriptors that are bound and unbound to
//! shaders as a single unit. The contents of each descriptor in a set is defined by a
//! `DescriptorSetLayout` which is in turn built of [`DescriptorSetLayoutBinding`]s. A `DescriptorSet`
//! is then allocated from a [`DescriptorPool`] using the `DescriptorSetLayout`, and specific [`Descriptor`]s are
//! then bound to each binding point in the set using a [`DescriptorSetWrite`] and/or [`DescriptorSetCopy`].
//! Each descriptor set may contain descriptors to multiple different sorts of resources, and a shader may
//! use multiple descriptor sets at a time.
