/// # Overview
///
/// A `Device` is responsible for creating and managing resources for the physical device
/// it was created from.
///
/// ## Resource Construction and Handling
///
/// This device structure can then be used to create and manage different resources, like buffers,
/// shader programs and textures. See the individual methods for more information.
///
/// ## Mutability
///
/// All the methods get `&self`. Any internal mutability of the `Device` is hidden from the user.
///
/// ## Synchronization
///
/// `Device` should be usable concurrently from multiple threads. The `Send` and `Sync` bounds
/// are not enforced at the HAL level due to OpenGL constraint (to be revised). Users can still
/// benefit from the backends that support synchronization of the `Device`.
