//! Logical graphics device.
//!
//! # Device
//!
//! This module exposes the [`Device`][Device] trait, which provides methods for creating
//! and managing graphics resources such as buffers, images and memory.
//!
//! The `Adapter` and `Device` types are very similar to the Vulkan concept of
//! "physical devices" vs. "logical devices"; an `Adapter` is single GPU
//! (or CPU) that implements a backend, a `Device` is a
//! handle to that physical device that has the requested capabilities
//! and is used to actually do things.
