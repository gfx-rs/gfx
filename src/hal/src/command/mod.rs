//! Command buffers.
//!
//! A command buffer collects a list of commands to be submitted to the device.
//!
//! Each command buffer has specific capabilities for graphics, compute or transfer operations,
//! and can be either a *primary* command buffer or a *secondary* command buffer.
//!
//! Operations are always initiated by a primary command buffer,
//! but a primary command buffer can contain calls to secondary command buffers
//! that contain snippets of commands that do specific things, similar to function calls.
//!
//! All the possible commands are exposed by the [`CommandBuffer`][CommandBuffer] trait.

// TODO: Document pipelines and subpasses better.
